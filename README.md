## Not Napster

### Background

This project is for the [Little Shop](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown) assignment for the Turing School of Software and Design. 

In it's essence, Not Napster is an e-commerce site for buying/selling mp3 codes of popular albums. New albums on vinyl often come with a redeemable code for a digital version of the album. This project creates a marketplace for buying/selling these codes among third parties.

### Configuration

* The project was built with Ruby on Rails.
* RSpec with capybara, database cleaner, and shoulda matchers were used for testing. Run the test suite with ```rspec```
* Stripe was used for processing paymemts.
* Postgres was used for databasing.
* Custom styling was used.
